      <description>About Me ðŸ‘‹    I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Developer from South Carolina who started as a QA tester writing code to automate repetitive, manual processes that were dipping into my team&amp;rsquo;s development time. After saving my team and myself hours on daily testing tasks, I was hooked on programming and started focusing more on writing code. Now I&amp;rsquo;m a completely dedicated Software Developer and still very much enjoy automating repetitive processes as part of my work.</description>
