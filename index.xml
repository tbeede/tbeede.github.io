      <description>Hello! ðŸ‘‹    This site was more of challenge to build than I had initially thought, but I managed to get it running. It utilizes a static site generator Hugo and a theme of your choosing to get started and modify.
In the future I may rewrite it all in whatever front-end technology happens to be the latest and greatest, but for now I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the way it looks and the ease of setting it all up.</description>

      <description>About Me ðŸ‘‹    I am currently a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) at Cofense, a company that produces phishing simulation software and other resources for the information security community. Aspects of this role that I have enjoyed most are
 Acting as the POC for automation tasks on my team (this includes failures/fires as well!) Improving the test suites we have for performance and stability (nobody likes flakey, slow specs) Incorporating build pipelines to run our regression suite at least nightly, as well as making release testing much smoother and providing far more coverage than testing all areas of the app &amp;lsquo;by hand&amp;rsquo;  I&amp;rsquo;m most interested in expanding my skillset into the information security and cloud engineering realms and I am looking to start with some certifications in each field to grow my skills.</description>
